# Delete a Recovery Services vault

This article describes how to delete an [Azure Backup](backup-overview.md) Recovery Services vault. It contains instructions for removing dependencies and then deleting a vault, and deleting a vault by force.




## Before you start

Before you start, it's important to understand that you can't delete a Recovery Services vault that has servers registered in it, or that holds backup data.


- To delete a vault gracefully, unregister servers in it, and remove vault data.
- If you don't want to retain any data in the Recovery Services vault, and want to delete the vault, you can delete the vault by force.
- If you try to delete a vault, but can't, the vault is still configured to receive backup data.

To learn how to delete a vault, see the section, [Delete a vault from Azure portal](backup-azure-delete-vault.md#delete-a-vault-from-azure-portal). If section, [Delete the vault by force](backup-azure-delete-vault.md#delete-the-recovery-services-vault-by-force). If you aren't sure what's in the vault, and you need to make sure that you can delete the vault, see the section, [Remove vault dependencies and delete vault](backup-azure-delete-vault.md#remove-vault-dependencies-and-delete-vault).

## Delete a vault from the Azure portal

1. Open your list of Recovery Services vaults in the portal.
2. From the list, select the vault you want to delete. The vault dashboard opens.

    ![select your vault to open its dashboard](./media/backup-azure-delete-vault/contoso-bkpvault-settings.png)

1. In the vault dashboard, click **Delete**. Verify that you want to delete.

    ![Vault deletion error](./media/backup-azure-delete-vault/vault-delete-error.png)

    - Follow these instructions to remove dependencies before deleting the vault, review
    - [Follow these instructions](#delete-the-recovery-services-vault-by-force) to use PowerShell to delete the vault by force. 

## Delete the Recovery Services vault by force

[!INCLUDE [updated-for-az](../../includes/updated-for-az.md)]

You can use PowerShell to delete a Recovery Services vault by force. This means that the vault, and all associated backup data is permanently deleted. 

> [!Warning]
> When using PowerShell to delete a Recovery Services vault, verify that you want to permanently delete all backup data in the vault.
>

To delete a Recovery Services vault:

1. Sign in to your Azure subscription with the `Connect-AzAccount` command, and follow the on-screen directions.

   ```powershell
    Connect-AzAccount
   ```
2. The first time you use Azure Backup, you must register the Azure Recovery Service provider in your subscription with [Register-AzResourceProvider](/powershell/module/az.Resources/Register-azResourceProvider).

   ```powershell
    Register-AzResourceProvider -ProviderNamespace "Microsoft.RecoveryServices"
   ```

3. Open a PowerShell window with Administrator privileges.
4. Use `Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted` to remove any restrictions.
5. Run the following command to download the Azure Resource Manager Client package from chocolately.org.

    `iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))`

6. Use the following command to install the Azure Resource Manager API Client.

   `choco.exe install armclient`

7. In the Azure portal, gather the subscription ID and resource group name for the vault you want to delete.
8. In PowerShell, run the following command using your subscription ID, resource group name, and vault name. When you run the command, it deletes the vault and all dependencies.

   ```powershell
   ARMClient.exe delete /subscriptions/<subscriptionID>/resourceGroups/<resourcegroupname>/providers/Microsoft.RecoveryServices/vaults/<recovery services vault name>?api-version=2015-03-15
   ```
9. If the vault's not empty, you receive the error "Vault cannot be deleted as there are existing resources within this vault". To remove a contained within a vault, do the following:

   ```powershell
   ARMClient.exe delete /subscriptions/<subscriptionID>/resourceGroups/<resourcegroupname>/providers/Microsoft.RecoveryServices/vaults/<recovery services vault name>/registeredIdentities/<container name>?api-version=2016-06-01
   ```

10. Sign in to your subscription in the Azure portal and verify that the vault is deleted.

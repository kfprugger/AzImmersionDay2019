# Security Attributes for Azure Backup

Security is integrated into every aspect of an Azure service. This article addresses the security attributes built into Azure Backup. A security attribute is a quality or feature of an Azure service that contributes to the service's ability to prevent, detect, or respond to security vulnerabilities.

Security attributes are categorized as:
* Preventative
* Network segmentation
* Detection
* Identity and access management support
* Audit trail
* Access controls (if used)
* Configuration management (if used)

In each category, we identify if an attribute is used or not (yes/no). For some services an attribute may not be applicable and is shown as N/A. A note or a link to more information about an attribute may also be provided.

- This should be very familiar since we just did this in Exercise 3. Please use your own resource group, not the one referenced in the material called "partsunlmited" in the Azure SQL database creation in **Step 4**. 
- Also in **Step 4**, you are advised to create a logical SQL Server instance like you did in [Exercise 3: Step 3](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/provision-azure-sql-db/3-create-your-database). This is unnecessary. Please use the same SQL server instance your created in Exercise 3 instead of creating a new one as the directions suggest.

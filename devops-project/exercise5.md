- This should be very familiar since we just did this in Exercise 3. Please use your own resource group, not the one referenced in the material called "partsunlmited" in the Azure SQL database creation in **Step 4**. 
- Also in **Step 4**, you are advised to create a logical SQL Server instance like you did in [Exercise 3: Step 3](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/provision-azure-sql-db/3-create-your-database). This is unnecessary. Please use the same SQL server instance your created in Exercise 3 instead of creating a new one as the directions suggest.
  - Walkthrough to provision the database since the UI has changed a bit since the DevOps lab documentation was published:
    - Click the **New aka the "+" icon in the top of the portal**. Type in **sql data** and you'll get a list of Azure SQL options.

- Walkthrough to provision the Web A0p since the UI has changed and we want to leverage the work you did in [Exercise 2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/host-a-web-app-with-azure-app-service/).
  - Click the **New aka the "+" icon in the top of the portal**. Type in **web app** and you'll get a list of Web app options. Next, select **Web App** and **Create**
